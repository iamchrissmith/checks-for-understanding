1. What's one difference between ES5 and ES6?

ES6 is moving JS to more natively support OOP.  One instance of this is the new Class structure.

2. What's the difference between asynchronous and synchronous JavaScript? 

synchonous JS runs all at once where as asynchronous allows us to tell the program to run Y line of code after X has happened successfully.

3. What are the four pillars of Object Oriented programming?

Abstraction - only show the outside world what is needed for it to interact with an object.  
Polymorphism - can redefine functionality by reusing a name  
Inheritance - create and share code through relationships between classes  
Encapsulation - bind data and functions together in one class  

4. What are some tools available in JavaScript to help you write object oriented code?

`Class`es `static` methods and instance methods.

5. What are some key concepts to be aware of when refactoring your JavaScript?

Watch for code smells, follow SRP, watch for async problems/nested callbacks.
